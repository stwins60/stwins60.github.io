This is the website of me, Idris Fagbemi, and it has my work experience, personal projects, and general info about me.

I'm a System Analyst at Medline Inc., Illinois Institute of Technology alumni, and used to work as a private tutor for Java, SQL and web development.

In my free time I like to watch movies, play video games, and learning.

Check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/stwins60/) for code that I make, and message me if you'd like to get tutored on something or have any questions.
