## Q: Cool site. Can I have one like this?

A: Yes!

HOWEVER! I recommend Hugo more. Jekyll is dusty AF and a PITA bread to get installed on Windows, and uses old Ruby versions.

Use Hugo instead. I am still using Jekyll because I don't have time to redo this site, and it works 'good enuf'.

Clone <http://github.com/HenryFBP/henryFBP.github.io> and just edit it and reupload it to GitHub!

Alternatively, you can [fork it](https://github.com/HenryFBP/henryfbp.github.io/fork).

See [this link](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-a-repository-for-your-site) for more info.

## Q: Nice favicon. Where's it from?

A: Thanks! My good friend flexadecimal made it. He is a very talented C programmer. Go give him free coffee and car parts.
