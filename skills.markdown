This section is a detailed breakdown of my skills and knowledge. A resume for people who like to read!

## Interpersonal
### Tutoring
I have worked as a tutor for around 1 years.

While working the position, I was tasked with meeting with people, talking about homework, breaking down assignments,
and teaching people how to complete their assignments.


## Technical
### Linux
I am used to configuring and modifying Linux to install software, run startup tasks, build code, and deploy
applications.

An example of this is a '[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)file' including setup shell scripts to build and deploy an
Apache Tomcat application that I wrote. ZIP files of this project can be provided upon request as this code resides in
a private repository.


### Packer

Packer is a tool for creating OS images that can be built reliably. Something such as installing MySQL on Linux and 
running that in a virtual machine can be tedious and annoying to do manually.

I have a collection of Packer files below.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for managing and building virtual machines in an automated fashion.

I use Vagrant for setting up penetrable and pentesting boxes.

I maintain a collection of Vagrant files that can be used for pentesting, testing Windows software, etc.
